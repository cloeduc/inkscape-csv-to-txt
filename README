-------------------------- README --------------------------

This is an extension for Inkscape that add a menu to replace
a specific text from csv to the selected objets, and duplicate
the selection as many objets as lines on CSV


----------------------- INSTALLATION -----------------------

To install the extension, generate_text_from_csv.py and generate_text_from_csv.inx
have to reside in Inkscape's extensions folder. You can copy
them into a local extension folder.
  Linux: ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/
  Windows: C:\Documents and Settings\<UserName>\Application Data\Inkscape\extensions\

If you do this, you may have to uncomment some lines in
generate_text_from_csv.py to ensure that the file can find inkex.py.

Another (easier) way to do this in Linux while still keeping
the extension easy to update is to create symbolic links.
  cd <folder containing generate_text_from_csv.py and generate_text_from_csv.inx>
  sudo ln -s ./generate_text_from_csv.py /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/generate_text_from_csv.py
  sudo ln -s ./generate_text_from_csv.inx /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/generate_text_from_csv.inx

-------------------------- USAGE ---------------------------

- Select objets
---> You must have a pink rectangle to suround all of yours objets
---> You must have a texte object who contains your searched text
- Go to Extensions > Generate From CSV > From CSV text Generator
